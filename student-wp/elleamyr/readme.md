I'm currently studying at [Universiti Teknologi Malaysia](https://www.utm.my), and I'm passionate about all things tech! I'm a self-taught HTML and CSS coder with experience in designing responsive and user-friendly websites. I've also worked as a **Quality Analyst** at **ByteDance**, where I was responsible for ensuring the quality and safety of TikTok Livestream Videos.

In addition to my technical skills, I'm also skilled in digital marketing, with hands-on experience in campaigns and strategies. I'm always **looking for ways to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends.**

On my GitHub profile, you'll find some of my personal projects and contributions to open-source projects. Feel free to check them out and connect with me! I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations.
