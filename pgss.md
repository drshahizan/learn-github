| No | Lesson | Description |
|--------|---------|---------|
| 1. | [Installation & Sign in Github](./materials/pgss/signin.md)|
| 2. | [Introduction to Github](./materials/pgss/intro.md)| GitHub is a powerful collaboration platform and code hosting service for version control using Git. It offers GitHub Education2, which provides students, teachers, and schools with access to the tools and events necessary for software development education. Additionally, GitHub supports developer growth through roadmaps3, which are comprehensive guides that outline paths for learning various technologies and best practices in the field, helping developers to navigate their educational journey and career progression effectively. |
| 3. | [Github Profile](./materials/pgss/profile.md)| A GitHub profile is a public facing page that displays a user's activity on the platform. It includes information such as the user's username, profile picture, bio, location, and links to their website or social media profiles. The main focus of a GitHub profile is the user's repositories. Repositories are collections of files that contain a project or a portion of a project. On a GitHub profile, users can showcase their repositories, which can be sorted by type (public or private), language, and date. Each repository includes information such as the name, description, number of stars (a measure of popularity), and the number of forks (when someone makes a copy of the repository to make their own changes).|
| 4. | [Github Pages](./materials/pgss/profile.md)| GitHub Pages is a web hosting service provided by GitHub that allows users to create and host static websites directly from their GitHub repositories. With GitHub Pages, users can publish websites for personal or project use, including blogs, portfolios, and documentation. Users can choose to host their site on a custom domain or a GitHub-provided subdomain, and can create and edit their site using a variety of tools and languages, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. GitHub Pages is a powerful and easy-to-use tool for creating and hosting websites, and is a popular choice for developers, designers, and individuals looking to build an online presence.|
| 5. | [Github Projects](./materials/projects/readme.md)| GitHub is a web-based platform that is widely used for version control and collaborative software development. GitHub projects refer to the various software projects that are hosted on the platform. When a project is hosted on GitHub, developers can create and manage the project's code, track its changes over time, and collaborate with other developers on the project. Each project has its own repository, which is a central location where all the project's files and code are stored.|
| 6. | [Github Codespaces](./materials/education/codespace.md)| GitHub Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment that allows developers to create, customize, and use a fully-functional development environment in the cloud. With Codespaces, developers can quickly and easily set up a development environment for their projects, without the need to install software on their local machines. They can access their codespaces from anywhere, collaborate with their team members in real-time, and deploy their applications to production. Codespaces support a wide range of programming languages and tools, including PHP, and provide a powerful and flexible platform for building, testing, and deploying web applications.|
| 7.|  [Tools and useful links](./materials/tools.md)| Various tools and useful links for developers, particularly those using Git and GitHub. Some of the tools mentioned include StackEdit and Dillinger for editing and formatting Markdown documents, GitHub Skills for learning and improving Git and GitHub skills, and Awesome README Tools for creating more engaging and informative README files for projects. There are also links to various resources for tracking project statistics, including Todoist Stats in Readme, Github Readme Stats, and Github Contributor Stats. Additionally, there are tools for creating visitor badges, profile activity generators, and more. Overall, these tools and resources can help developers to be more productive and make their projects more accessible and engaging for users. |
