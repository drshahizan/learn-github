# Github Projects
GitHub is a web-based platform that is widely used for version control and collaborative software development. GitHub projects refer to the various software projects that are hosted on the platform.

When a project is hosted on GitHub, developers can create and manage the project's code, track its changes over time, and collaborate with other developers on the project. Each project has its own repository, which is a central location where all the project's files and code are stored.

One of the key features of GitHub is its ability to track changes made to a project over time. This is done through the use of Git, a distributed version control system. Git allows developers to create branches of the code, make changes, and merge those changes back into the main branch when they are ready.

GitHub projects also include a range of other features that help with collaboration and project management. For example, developers can use issues to track bugs or feature requests, create pull requests to propose changes to the code, and use project boards to manage their work and keep track of what needs to be done.

In addition to its features for software development, GitHub also has a strong community of users who contribute to open source projects. This makes it a valuable resource for developers who are looking to share their work, collaborate with others, and learn from others in the field.

## Tools in Github Projects
GitHub Projects offer several different tools to help developers manage their work and track progress on software projects. Three of the most useful tools are tables, boards, and roadmaps.

### 1. Tables
Tables are a way of organizing data in a tabular format within GitHub projects. Tables can be used to track tasks, issues, bugs, or any other type of information that needs to be organized in a grid. Tables can be customized with columns and labels to suit the needs of the project. They are particularly useful for tracking tasks that are not yet assigned to a particular team member, as they allow anyone to pick up a task and work on it.

### 2. Boards
Boards are a Kanban-style project management tool that allow developers to visualize the progress of tasks as they move through different stages of completion. Boards are customizable, so developers can create columns to represent different stages of the development process, such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." Each task or issue can be represented by a card that is moved between columns as work progresses. Boards can be used by individuals or teams to keep track of their work and ensure that nothing falls through the cracks.

### 3. Roadmaps
Roadmaps are a way of visualizing the long-term goals and milestones for a project. GitHub Projects offer a built-in roadmap feature that allows developers to create and manage high-level plans for their projects. Roadmaps can be used to track progress towards major milestones, identify dependencies between different tasks, and communicate project timelines to stakeholders. Roadmaps can be updated as needed to reflect changes in the project plan or to adjust timelines based on feedback from stakeholders.

Overall, tables, boards, and roadmaps are powerful tools that help developers stay organized and on track as they work on software projects. They allow developers to visualize the progress of work, manage complex projects, and communicate plans and progress to stakeholders.

### How to use tables, boards, and roadmaps in GitHub Projects

### 1. Tables
- Navigate to the GitHub repository where your project is located and click on the Projects tab.
- Click on the "Create a project" button and select "Table" as the project template.
- Customize the table by adding columns and labels that match the needs of your project.
- Create cards to represent tasks or issues that need to be tracked and assign them to team members as needed.
- Update the table as work progresses by moving cards between columns or updating card information.

### 2. Boards
- Navigate to the GitHub repository where your project is located and click on the Projects tab.
- Click on the "Create a project" button and select "Board" as the project template.
- Customize the board by adding columns and labels that match the needs of your project.
- Create cards to represent tasks or issues that need to be tracked and assign them to team members as needed.
- Update the board as work progresses by moving cards between columns or updating card information.

### 3. Roadmaps
- Navigate to the GitHub repository where your project is located and click on the Projects tab.
- Click on the "Create a project" button and select "Roadmap" as the project template.
- Add milestones and dates that correspond to major goals or deliverables in the project.
- Create issues or tasks that need to be completed in order to reach each milestone.
- Update the roadmap as work progresses by adding new tasks or adjusting milestone dates as needed.

Keep in mind that these are just general guidelines, and the exact steps for using tables, boards, and roadmaps in GitHub Projects may vary depending on your specific project needs. Additionally, it's important to communicate with your team members and stakeholders to ensure that everyone understands how to use these tools effectively and that they are updated regularly to reflect the most current information.
