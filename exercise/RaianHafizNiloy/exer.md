You can render LaTeX mathematical expressions using [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/):

The *Gamma function* satisfying $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\quad\forall n\in\mathbb N$ is via the Euler integral

$$
\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.
$$

> You can find more information about **LaTeX** mathematical expressions [here](http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference).
You can render UML diagrams using [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/). For example, this will produce a sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob-->>John: How about you John?
Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
```

And this will produce a flow chart:

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Square Rect] -- Link text --> B((Circle))
A --> C(Round Rect)
B --> D{Rhombus}
C --> D
```

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods 🔬, processes 📊, algorithms 💻, and systems 🖥️ to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It combines aspects of statistics 📈, computer science 💾, and domain knowledge 🌐 to analyze and interpret complex data sets.

Key components include:

Data Collection 🗂️: Gathering data from various sources.

Data Cleaning 🧹: Removing noise and inconsistencies to improve data quality.

Data Exploration 🔎: Analyzing data to discover patterns and relationships.

Data Modeling 📐: Using algorithms and statistical models to make predictions or classifications.

Data Visualization 📊: Creating visual representations to communicate findings clearly.

Data science is vital in fields like healthcare 🏥, finance 💰, marketing 📈, and technology 🧑‍💻, driving decision-making and innovation.
