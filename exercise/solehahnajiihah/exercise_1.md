# Data Science

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that utilizes scientific methods, algorithms, processes, and systems to extract insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data. It combines various domains including statistics, mathematics, computer science, and domain expertise to analyze and interpret complex data sets.

## Key Components of Data Science:

### 1. Data Collection:
   - Gathering raw data from various sources such as databases, APIs, sensors, or files.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
   - Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data into a usable format.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Analyzing and visualizing data to discover patterns, trends, and relationships.

### 4. Feature Engineering:
   - Selecting, extracting, or transforming features to improve model performance.

### 5. Modeling:
   - Building predictive or descriptive models using machine learning, statistical techniques, or other algorithms.

### 6. Evaluation and Validation:
   - Assessing model performance using metrics and validating the results.

### 7. Deployment:
   - Integrating models into production systems for real-world applications.
