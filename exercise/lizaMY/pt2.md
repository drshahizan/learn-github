# Programming C++ with Object-Oriented Approach

## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to programming in C++ using an object-oriented approach. You will learn the fundamentals of the C++ language and how to apply object-oriented principles to design and implement efficient and maintainable software solutions.

Throughout the course, you will gain hands-on experience by working on various programming assignments and projects. You will learn to write C++ programs that leverage the power of object-oriented programming, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
