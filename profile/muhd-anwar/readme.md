## About Me 🚀

### Research Interests
- **Augmented Reality (AR)**
- **Occlusion Handling**
- **Depth-Based Techniques**
- **Model-Based Methods**

### Summary of Research 

#### **Review of Model-Based Techniques in Augmented Reality Occlusion Handling**
- **Authors**: Muhammad Anwar Ahmad, Norhaida Mohd Suaib, Ajune Wanis Ismail
- **Abstract**: This review focuses on model-based methods for occlusion handling. It classifies existing approaches as depth-based or model-based. The paper provides insights into the current state-of-the-art literature and challenges in this field³.

#### Comparison of AR Frameworks
- **Vuforia**: Utilizes Model Target features for depth masks and occlusion handling³.
- **Photogrammetry-Based AR**: Incorporates close-range photogrammetry for 3D reconstruction and real-time orientation tracking. Efficiently solves occlusion problems⁴.

#### Depth Data Extraction
- **Structure from Motion**: A technique used for depth estimation³.


## Skills 🛠️

- Programming languages: C++, C#, HTML, PHP
- Development: Unity
- Other tools: Git, Docker, LXD

Here are some of the projects that I have worked on or contributed to:

### Beep 🔋

Beep is a simple Python GUI application that helps a user limit the number of charge-cycles they use, thereby increasing the lifespan of the laptop battery. The theory behind this is that a laptop battery has a number of predefined charge-cycles, and every time we charge a battery to 100%, we lose one cycle. For this reason, manufacturers recommend that you shouldn't charge your battery to 100% all the time. The charge percentage is, however, hard to keep track of; therefore, Beep notifies you when your battery reaches a certain threshold (80%).

## Work Experience 💼

- I have worked for several companies over the last couple of years, starting in 2021 where I took an intern role at Pelican International, a procurement company based in Kampala. I then worked on a number of projects with Inter Miles, Code Sync and also did several projects under the mentorship of [Chris Kateera](https://github.com/chris-kck) built on [Frappe Framework: Open Source Low Code Framework](https://frappeframework.com). More recently, I worked at AfroFleet Technologies (South Africa) and Bitcoin Innovation Hub (Uganda) before resuming my studies here at UTM.

## Education and Training 🎓

- Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering (Hons.) at Makerere University (2018 - 2023)
- Certificate of Accomplishment in the Blockchain Innovation Program, Uganda (2022 - 2023). Also emerged as the overall best student in the cohort.

## Blog 📝

I regularly write articles on my blog about various topics related to software engineering, blockchain, and more. Here are some of my recent posts:
